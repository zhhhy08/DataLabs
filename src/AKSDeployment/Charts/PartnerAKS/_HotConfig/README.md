# HotConfigs

This folder is just meant to store HotConfigs for ease of access. 10/30/2023 is the Public Preview for Azure Business Continuity team, I'm just storing some yaml files that can be used for certain commands for mitigation, until we get proper support for Geneva Actions. Please follow the [ConfigChanges TSG](https://eng.ms/docs/cloud-ai-platform/azure-core/azure-management-and-platforms/control-plane-bburns/azure-resource-graph/azure-resource-graph/datalabs/tsgs/configchange) to create a config change without the templates that are found here.

Expected yaml file will include the yaml file and the command to run it
