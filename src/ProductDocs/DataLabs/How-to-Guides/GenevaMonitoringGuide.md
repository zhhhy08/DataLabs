# [DataLabs] Partner Monitoring Account Setup

Monitoring account setup is a prerequisite for onboarding to Data Labs as a solution. We ask that you create a preliminary Geneva Account shell, and we will add some more information to it.

**NOTE:** Geneva Account configurations are coupled to the tech stack of Data Labs (AKS, Linux). We request that you provision a new Geneva Account, rather than re-using an existing account as multiple configurations under an account is discouraged by the Geneva Team (particularly for Logs).

Please follow the UI and documentation of the Geneva team to set up a:

* Test Account for INT 

* Production Account for your solution in Canary and PROD
